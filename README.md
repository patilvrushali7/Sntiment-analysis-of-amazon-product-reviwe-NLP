4)Natural Language Processing

Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the branch of computer science—and more
specifically, the branch of artificial intelligence or AI—concerned with giving computers the
ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can. It
allows machines to break down and interpret human language.

5)EDA
Normalizing the data
To remove both the leading and the trailing characters
To remove empty strings
Joining the list into one string/text
Removing Punctuations
Tokenization / Removing stopwords / Lemmatization / Stemming
Joining the data
Named Entity Recognition (NER)
TF-IDF Vectorizer
Generate Word Cloud
Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Filtering and counting the nouns and verbs tokens
(Barchart for top 10 nouns + verbs)
6)Sentiment Analysis (Using Affin.csv)
Sentiment Analysis (Using VADER)
One of the most important fields or techniques of NLP is sentiment analysis.

Sentimental analysis is the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), or
other data analysis techniques to analyze the data and provides some insights from the data. It is
the process of detecting positive, negative, or neutral sentiment in the text.

We have used fine grained sentiment analysis which gives an understanding of customer feedback.
We can obtain a precise result in terms of the polarity of the input. The labels of the review will be
as
Positive
Extremely positive
Negative
Extremely Negative
Neutral

7)Deployment using Streamlit
